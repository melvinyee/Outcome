	<h2>1.Describe the common devices of screen resolution for web pages</h2>
	<h2>Answer</h2>
	<p>
		In today's world, people can choose a lot of equipment, and can make all the equipment on the best experience to	
		accommodate and build up, it will be a daunting task. However, when designing websites and mobile sites, be sure to understand the most popular screen size and resolution. Optimize and respond to the site so that users are fluent and ultimately enjoy a pleasant experience for your audience. 
	</p>
	<p>
		When you purchase a device, you will often see the screen size and resolution listed in the specifications. The screen size is the physical measurement of the diagonal of the screen, in inches. This is not confused with resolution, and the resolution is the number of pixels on the screen that are usually displayed at a height (ie 1024 x 768). Because devices with the same screen size can have very different resolutions, the developer uses the viewport when creating a mobile-friendly page.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many of the site solution is to provide different pages for different devices, such as dedicated to provide a mobile version, or iPhone / iPad version. This is a guarantee of the effect, but it is cumbersome to maintain several versions at the same time, and if a site has multiple portal (portal), will greatly increase the complexity of architecture design.
