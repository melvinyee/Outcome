	<h2>1.Identify and categories the different web sites and its functions. </h2>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p>
		Mobile phone screen is relatively small, the width is usually below 600 pixels; PC screen width, generally more than 1000 pixels (the current mainstream width is 1366 × 768), and some also reached 2000 pixels. The same content, to the size of the screen, have shown a satisfactory effect, is not an easy thing.
		Many of the site solution is to provide different pages for different devices, such as dedicated to provide a mobile version, or iPhone / iPad version. This is a guarantee of the effect, but it is cumbersome to maintain several versions at the same time, and if a site has multiple portal (portal), will greatly increase the complexity of architecture design.

	<h2>4.Identify and explain the different page layout styles for different web sites. </h2>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p>
		Simple, lightweight pages directly with media query to achieve responsiveness is very good. Such as blog, small business station and the like. Now the CSS framework is basically responsive. But please note that the response is not just a responsive layout. For large stations simply use media query is not enough. So in the same controller layer, identify UA, rendering different versions of the template, the combination of the corresponding static resources. This is also a response. Development and maintenance costs improved significantly. When the differences between the various versions are large, maintenance costs are likely to be large enough to be unacceptable. Even if the split, the structure should also be adjusted, back-end service, application layer app. According to the technical characteristics of different companies, adjust the cost is difficult to say whether it is feasible. For large stations, separate to do more clearly, while using responsive components to solve the problem of reuse, functional synchronization. For example, the original select controls, pc, android, ios have different presentation and interaction, but the usage is consistent. Similarly, generic business components can do the same. Web component will eventually solve the problem after the popularity of the problem. Now this stage, you can design class web component of the program.
